# Logos Library: Roadmap to Public Release

**Current Status**: Private development with quality control

---

## The Benchmark for Public Release

The library goes public when ALL criteria are met:

### Criterion 1: Deep Theorems Milestone
- [ ] Robertson's Uncertainty Principle ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [ ] Stone's Theorem **IN PROGRESS** (est. 3-6 months)
- [ ] One additional major theorem from: Ryu-Takayanagi, Padmanabhan, or Black Hole Thermodynamics

**Rationale**: Prove we can handle graduate-level physics formalization at scale.

### Criterion 2: Section Completeness
- [ ] Units: Comprehensive coverage ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [ ] Classes: At least 5 complete courses ✅ **COMPLETE** (Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Physics, Chemistry, QM)
- [ ] Deep Theorems: 3+ major proofs (2/3 done)
- [ ] Detectors: 2+ operational validators (1/2 done - need one more)

**Rationale**: Each section must demonstrate viability.

### Criterion 3: Documentation Quality
- [ ] Every section has README
- [ ] Installation tested by external party
- [ ] All major theorems have blueprints
- [ ] Contributing guidelines clear
- [ ] License finalized

**Rationale**: Public release means public contributors. Must be accessible.

### Criterion 4: Code Quality
- [ ] No `sorry` in main branch (except documented WIP sections)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] CI/CD operational
- [ ] Dependency versions documented

**Rationale**: First impression matters. Ship quality.

### Criterion 5: Strategic Timing
- [ ] Stone's Theorem complete (demonstrates sustained capability)
- [ ] Team ready for public engagement
- [ ] Backup systems in place

**Rationale**: Once public, there's no going back. Be ready.

## Current Progress Tracking

| Criterion | Status | Completion |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Deep Theorems Milestone | 🟡 In Progress | 66% (2/3) |
| Section Completeness | 🟡 In Progress | 75% (3/4) |
| Documentation Quality | 🟢 On Track | 80% (4/5) |
| Code Quality | 🟢 Good | 90% |
| Strategic Timing | 🟡 Waiting | Depends on Stone |

**Overall**: ~75% toward public release

---

## Timeline Estimates

### Optimistic (6 months)
- Stone complete in 3 months
- Second detector + one more theorem in 3 months
- Public release: Q2 2026

### Realistic (9-12 months)
- Stone complete in 4-6 months
- Additional work in 3-6 months
- Public release: Q3-Q4 2026

### Conservative (18 months)
- Unexpected complications with Stone
- Need to strengthen foundations
- Public release: Q1 2027

**Current bet**: Realistic timeline (Q3-Q4 2026)

## Phase 1: Soft Launch (Private)

**Status**: CURRENT PHASE ✅

- [x] Private GitHub repository set up
- [x] MIT license selected
- [x] Core team (2 people)
- [x] Robertson's theorem complete
- [ ] Stone's theorem in progress
- [ ] Quality control ongoing

---

## Phase 2: Completion Sprint

**Goals**:
- Complete Stone's theorem
- Build second detector (likely black hole thermodynamics or quantum computing)
- Complete one more major theorem (Ryu-Takayanagi recommended - ties to holography)
- Polish documentation

**Estimated Duration**: 6-12 months

**Blockers**:
- Stone's spectral theorem machinery (hardest part)
- Mathlib may need updates (coordinate carefully)
- Need to maintain quality while moving fast

---

## Phase 3: Pre-Release Polish

**Tasks**:
- [ ] External installation test (recruit non-team member)
- [ ] Code review of all sections
- [ ] Documentation completeness check
- [ ] Write public README (different from private version)
- [ ] Prepare announcement materials
- [ ] Set up public issue templates
- [ ] Plan for handling influx of attention

**Estimated Duration**: 1 month

---

## Phase 4: Public Launch

**Launch Venues**:
1. **Hacker News** - Tech/AI community
2. **Lean Zulip** - Formal verification community
3. **r/math, r/physics** - Academic communities
4. **AI Safety forums** - Epistemic immune system angle
5. **Academic papers** - Formal publication of major theorems

**Launch Message**:
> "Logos Library: 100k+ lines of formally verified physics, from units to uncertainty principles to black hole thermodynamics. Open source (MIT). Designed as AI training corpus and human education tool."

**Expected Reactions**:
- Formal verification people: "This is awesome!"
- Physicists: "Wait, you can DO that?"
- AI safety people: "We need this yesterday"
- Skeptics: "Prove it" (we can!)

---

## Phase 5: Community Building

**First 3 months post-release**:
- Respond to all issues within 48 hours
- Accept high-quality PRs quickly
- Write blog posts explaining major theorems
- Give talks at conferences
- Build contributor community

**First 6 months**:
- Establish regular release cadence
- Mentor new contributors
- Expand theorem coverage
- Add more detectors

**First year**:
- 10+ external contributors
- 150k+ lines of verified code
- Recognition in formal verification and physics communities

---

## Success Metrics

### At Launch
- [ ] 100k+ verified lines
- [ ] 3+ major theorems proven
- [ ] 5+ courses complete
- [ ] 2+ detectors operational

### 6 Months Post-Launch
- [ ] 5+ external contributors
- [ ] 10+ GitHub stars (quality > quantity)
- [ ] 1+ citation in academic work

### 1 Year Post-Launch
- [ ] 150k+ verified lines
- [ ] 10+ external contributors
- [ ] Used in at least one course/research project
- [ ] Media coverage (Quanta, etc.)

### 5 Years (The Dream)
- [ ] 1M+ verified lines
- [ ] Standard reference for formal physics
- [ ] Used in AI training pipelines
- [ ] Multiple academic papers citing it

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- Stone's theorem harder than expected → Delay by 3-6 months
- Mathlib breaking changes → Need to refactor
- Performance issues at scale → Need optimization

**Mitigation**: Conservative timelines, careful mathlib updates, incremental testing

### Community Risks
- Low interest → Build anyway, it's valuable even small
- Hostile reception → Focus on quality, let work speak
- Wrong contributors → Clear standards in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Mitigation**: Clear standards, responsive maintainers, welcoming but rigorous

### Sustainability Risks
- Team burnout → Pace ourselves, celebrate milestones
- Scope creep → Stay focused on core vision
- Funding needs → Explore grants if needed

**Mitigation**: Sustainable pace, clear scope, explore funding options

## Decision Gates

Before public release, answer these:

### Gate 1: Quality
- Is every section at publication quality?
- Can external person install and verify?
- Are all major bugs fixed?

### Gate 2: Completeness
- Do we have enough content to be useful?
- Is the vision clear from the repository?
- Are all benchmarks met?

### Gate 3: Readiness
- Are we ready for public engagement?
- Do we have time to handle issues/PRs?
- Is documentation adequate?

### Gate 4: Timing
- Is this a good time strategically?
- Any competing announcements?
- Team calendar clear?

**ALL GATES MUST BE GREEN BEFORE LAUNCH**

## Post-Release Priorities

### Year 1
1. Community building
2. Expand theorem coverage (QFT, cosmology, condensed matter)
3. More detectors (fusion, quantum computing, exotic materials)
4. More courses (statistical mechanics, solid state, etc.)

### Year 2-3
5. Begin AI training experiments
6. Academic partnerships
7. Grant funding for sustainability
8. Conference presentations

### Year 4-5
9. First AI-contributed theorems (with human verification)
10. 1M+ line milestone
11. Standard reference status
12. The vision realized

## The Long Game

This is not a sprint. It's a marathon toward 50M lines of verified science.

Public release is just the beginning.

The goal: Create infrastructure for verified truth that scales at AI speed while maintaining proof rigor.

**Current status**: ~75% toward public release. Stone's theorem is the bottleneck.

**Next milestone**: Complete Stone's theorem → Hit 75% on Deep Theorems criterion → Re-evaluate timeline.
