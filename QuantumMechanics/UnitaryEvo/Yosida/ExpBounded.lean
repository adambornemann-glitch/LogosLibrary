# Exponential of Bounded Operators

This module provides the theory of exponentials of bounded linear operators,
including the group law, adjoint formulas, and unitarity for skew-adjoint operators.

## Files

* `ExpBounded/Basic`: Definition and basic properties (group law, norm bounds)
* `ExpBounded/Adjoint`: Adjoint formulas (`exp(B)* = exp(B*)`)
* `ExpBounded/Unitary`: Unitarity results for skew-adjoint operators
